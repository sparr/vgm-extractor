# Game Data

Each yaml file in this directory corresponds to a single game.

## File Contents

Data in a file describes how to extract music from that game on different operating systems, distribution platforms, releases and versions, and from different installation methods and media. Additionally data may describe how to extract a suitable "cover art" image representing the game, as if the music were an album.

## File Names

Filenames should be capitalized consistent with the most common references to the game. Punctuation should be stripped unless it represents something other than punctuation in the name, and the name would be significantly less unique or recognizable without the punctuation. The full punctuated name of the game will be found inside the file.
