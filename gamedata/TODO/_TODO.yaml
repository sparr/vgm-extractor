DOTA 2:
# Valve vpk files not compatible with TF2/bin/vpk_linux32
# Some work in GCFscape http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=25 but can't find music

Forager:
- assets/audiogroup1.dat # maybe something using libiff can read this?

A Hat In Time:
# no obvious music files, possibly inside .umap levels?

Homeworld Remastered:
# needs tools like Homesong, Biggie, BigX to extract HW1 and HW2 music

# main game binary contains embedded kr3-desktop/assets/sounds/files/*.ogg

Limbo:
# "OGG" files that contain some weird RIFF audio

N++:
# Soundtrack.FSB file that doesn't work in http://aezay.dk/aezay/fsbextractor/

Rust:
# ???

# $ gunzip -S dat sounds.dat
# gzip: sounds.dat: invalid compressed data--format violated
