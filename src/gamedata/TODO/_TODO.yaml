# data/*.bin can be extracted to .core files with https://github.com/Jayveer/Decima-Explorer windows binary
# this produces .core files that might be readable by https://github.com/ShadelessFox/decima which is java but needs windows libraries
# my test extracts of .core files with "music" in the name produced too small files, but I didn't extract them all to check

Forager:
- assets/audiogroup1.dat # maybe something using libiff can read this?

A Hat In Time:
# no obvious music files, possibly inside .umap levels?
